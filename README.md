Bugs:
- sometimes, the program doesn't exit immediately after typing "exit", but only after typing "exit" multiple times (but this doesn't always happen)
- commands like "ls" or commands using ";" only work without spaces inbetween/after them. For example "ls" works but "ls " doesn't, and "ls;cd .." works but "ls ; cd .." doesn't
